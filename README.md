# TypeNative

TypeNative is yet another programming language I'm creating. I'm doing this as a project to learn how to build compilers and design languages. Right now, it's just a hobby, but I want to turn it into a serious project later.

The goal of TypeNative is to make a language almost the same as **TypeScript**. However, it will **compile directly to machine code**. This means no interpreters and no runtime programs (like Node or Deno). You'll just get a single binary file that you can run, just like a program compiled from C or C++.
